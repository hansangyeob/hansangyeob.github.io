								<p> Hello to everyone who are visiting this page! My name is Han sang yeob. However, I use ‘Tony’ in RMIT. I am from south Korea! My student number is S3821179 and my personal e-mail address is ttonytony774@gmail.com. I can speak Korean, english and little bit of Vietnamese.   </p>
                                                               <p>I have worked as a tour guide in Vietnam for a one year from 2017 to 2018. I am really interested in Vietnam as the country is experiencing booming economy. As a student, I thought that I could learn more from it compare to the other developed countries.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/donate1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> There are many possible career paths that IT influences. These days, machine learning (so called deep learning), cloud computing, blockchain technology gets the limelight from all over the world. However, my personally interest is in IoT and gaming industry. When I was in university in Korea, my major was Mechanical engineering design, which is subject mostly dealing with the hardware. While I was learning about designing hardware, I had chance to learn about ‘Arduino’. It is so simple mechanism, electricity enables the hardware to move but software is crucial in this part. This simple mechanism has really got my attention, which was making something with the sensors as the way I demand. This little event made me curious about IT.  </p>
								<p> After dropped out of university in Korea, I came Vietnam to explore new culture whether it is suitable for my future career or not. When I was searching for suitable international school in HCM, I have found out that one of my Vietnamese friends have already graduated RMIT and working for Samsung as an engineer. I wasn’t really sure back at the time, so I have decided to enroll language course in RMIT. Fortunately, experience in language courses helped me to made decision to enroll IT as my major. </p>
								<p> When I was in university in Korea, I have learned to not give so much expectation which school will provide me. Being an active student will extend my chance to find a job. </p>

								<p> I haven’t tried this kind of personality test for a long time. Nowadays, it is really important to be aware of what kind of personality each people have and how can we make the best result of it. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/test1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> For the 16personality, I have got ‘Debater’. At first, it really sounded like bossy personality to me. However, in the website, they said debators seek for fun and thrill all the time. Personally, I don’t think individual personality really matters in the group assignments as long as they share the same goal. It is important for us to have owner spirt about their work and research. </p>

							<article id="Project">
								<h2 class="major">Project</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/donate1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> 1.Overview </p>
								<p> The aim of the project is to make more active charity culture in Vietnam through the online. Currently in Vietnam, there are many people who are in need of charity from the corporations or the other people. However, there are not many methods to donate money or talent. My application will be the platform for people who are in need in charity and who are willing to donate their money or talent in various way. </p>
								<p> 2. Motivation </p>
								<p> This project will be interesting because it shows Vietnamese new method to donate their money or talent. In the statistic from datareportal.com, Vietnamese have spent US$6billion on online purchases in 2018. However, it is quite out dated information, $40 is the average amount of money Vietnamese have spent on philanthropy in 2011. These numbers indicate that although Vietnamese spend a lot of money on online purchase, lack of awareness about charity and methods are the main problems of causing low charity. For these reasons, my project is about daily life donation for Vietnamese. </p>
								<p> 3. Description </p>
								<p> The main feature of my project is that it introduces to diversity of ways in way to donation. When you download this application, it requires your name, birthday, gender and bank account. Right after finishing filling out the basic information, you can choose categories that you are interested in. the first categories are between choosing whether your donation will be in tangible or intangible. If the customer has chosen tangible, four other categories will pop up. Categories are environment, orphan, social issue and natural disaster. For the example of environment issue, Mekong delta could be included. Mekong delta has been live hood for many people who lives near that region. However, recently, due to indiscriminate develop of industry, this area is dying out. To support this issue – because customer already have chosen to donate tangible value – customer will be informed Mekong Delta related news and situation which customer have options whether to donate or not. This donate questions will pop up twice a day in phone. Most importantly, the amount of donated money will be fixed around 20,000VND. Each case should have how much money they want to get donated. After reaching the goal, it will be disappeared automatically with notice. For customer, after one month, they will be noticed total amount of donation rate. If customers have chosen to donate intangible values, they will see the categories like cooking, language, education. They can donate their talent to orphanage or nursing home. This application has several strong features. First of all, all of the cases are related with Vietnam. customers could raise awareness about their own country’s problem and start to deal with it right away. Secondly, based on their donation, it will show related categories and cases they might be interested in it. It means customers can expend their view about other issues. Lastly, they could change awareness about donation which it does not have to be a huge amount of money. They will feel better after donating small amount of money twice a day. </p>
								<p> 4. Tool and technologies </p>
								<p> It is crucial for this project to approach the right process of choosing donor management systems with a wish list of fundraising features. For this reason, this project will require ‘Raiser’s Edge NXT’. This donor management software is latest smart cloud fundraising and relations management system. This program has been chosen most in this year from nonprofit organizations which are in need in clear and correct software for their server.  </p>
								<p> 5. Skills required </p>
								<p> Young Ko, the CEO of Social Consulting Group (SCG), said “know the country’s system, issues, and its resources, especially the ones pertaining to their area of expertise” about talent donation. I totally agree with this idea. Whether the form of donation is tangible or intangible, producers must know what people who are in need of donation wants. This app should be human – centered for donator and who gets donation. It is important to create steady server but we should establish organization with the sole goal of matching up talent and passionate donators with those seeking help. </p>
							        <p> 6. Outcome </p>
						                <p> In this networked economy, economics agents are quite clear: people donating their talents and people who are paying for the values created by the talents. Not for just talent donation, we could change total concept of donation. First of all, all of the cases are related with Vietnam. customers could raise awareness about their own country’s problem and start to deal with it right away. Secondly, based on their donation, it will show related categories and cases they might be interested in it. It means customers can expend their view about other issues. Lastly, they could change awareness about donation which it does not have to be a huge amount of money. They will feel better after donating small amount of money twice a day.</p>
